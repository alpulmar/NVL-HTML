                        integrated approach to health for more than 35 years. His interest in holistic health, 
                        combined with his love of pets, led him to pursue a Ph.D. in Natural Health & Nutrition

                        applied his knowledge and interest in developing pet accessories and consumable products for improving 
                        the health, safety, comfort and enjoyment of pets. His unique and innovative pet products have been 
                        issued dozens of patents. He received his BS Engineering degree from the State University of New York 
                        at Buffalo, his MS Business Degree (minor in Behavioral Sciences) from the University of Rochester,

                        <h2>OurPet's, Our Commitment...</h2>
                        Since founding The OurPet’s Company in 1995, we have dedicated extensive amounts of time to the understanding 
                        of pets’ critical link to nature. Along with proper nutrition, mental stimulation, physical exercise and veterinary 
                        care, The OurPet’s Company products help to maintain your pet’s health and wellness.
                        <br>
                        Our Beginning...
                        The OurPet’s Company began with the development of the elevated Big Dog Feeder. This product has brought the 
                        importance of ergonomically correct eating positions to the public, and the family of Healthy Pet Diners™ 
                        and Store-N-Feed™ Diners continues to be among the market’s leading products. They improve posture and comfort 
                        and minimize stress and damage to joints and muscles.
                        <br>
                        <h2>Our Patented Products...</h2>
                        Since the beginning, our goal has not changed – to develop and market high quality, innovative products for 
                        improving the health, safety, comfort and enjoyment of pets. We strive to develop truly unique and innovative 
                        products – in fact, almost all of our products are patented and are the only ones of their kind in the marketplace. 
                        This unique product design process begins by looking at the health, behavioral and lifestyle needs of pets and owners. 
                        By finding original ways to fill these needs, we offer problem-solving solutions to pet owners – and highly marketable 
                        products to retailers. In addition, OurPet’s products have won numerous industry awards.
                        <br>
                        <h2>Our Two-Brand Solution…</h2>
                        The OurPet’s Company recognizes the unique needs of our trade customers in both the pet specialty and 
                        food/drug/mass-market channels. That’s why we offer two unique brands to fulfill the needs of our diverse yet 
                        equally important customers. The OurPets brand caters to our pet specialty customers and consumers, while the 
                        Pet Zone brand focuses on the needs of the food/drug/mass market channel and shoppers.
                        <br>
                        <h2>Our Market Leadership...</h2>

                        that provide fun, rewarding mental and physical challenges, and Feline and Canine Waste Management to simplify the 
                        required maintenance needs of pets. Our customers and retailers look to us to provide the most innovative products
