    <p>The <strong>Iberian Pen√≠nsula</strong> is shaped today by an amalgam of two minor plates, the Iberian Plate and a part of the
    Alboran Plate, which have been relatively independent during the Cenozoic and have ended up trapped
    between two major plates, <strong>Nubia</strong> and <strong>Eurasia</strong>. This complex tectonic arrangement, together with the
    different stages of mechanical coupling-decoupling between the involved plates and the different rheology
    between the east and west of Iberia, has produced a relief pattern and a distribution of characteristic
    <strong>Cenozoic Basin</strong> and <strong>Ranges Deformation Belts</strong>, very different from other areas of the <strong>Western Europe
    Alpine</strong> foreland.</p>
    <p>Given its size, amount of <strong>Cenozoic deformation</strong>, and degree of geological knowledge, the interior of Iberia is a
    true natural laboratory for understanding the interactions between farfield stresses occurring at the plate
    borders and the formation and evolution of intraplate basins and chains.</p>
    <p>Intraplate ranges in the <strong>Iberian Peninsula</strong> offer a genuine sample of possible structural styles. On the one
    hand, the presence or absence of sedimentary cover, mainly represented by Mesozoic sediments, produces
    two sets of well-differentiated ranges. Thus, in the eastern part and fitting with the location of Permo-Triasic
    and Cretaceous rifting processes, the ranges related to the Iberian Chain were developed with an important
    tectonic inversion. Although the deformation involves the basement, detachments also appear in the cover.
    In contrast, the absence of a sedimentary cover and previous extensional structures in the western part
    excludes tectonic inversion. Therefore, here Cenozoic deformation developed over an area with a more
    homogeneous rheology, which produced a fairly regular distribution pattern of Cenozoic chains, basins,
    and deformation belts.</p>
    <p>In these ranges without cover (developed in the Variscan Massif), several types of structures can be
    distinguished depending on the nature of the basement and their position with respect to large lithospheric
    and crustal folds, which seem to follow their formation. These structures correspond to pop-ups and triangle zones; 
    monoclinal ramps with the formation of a <strong>basin in the footwall</strong>; <strong>basement imbricate thick-skinned</strong> and
    <strong>thin-skinned thrust systems</strong>; and <strong>piggyback basins</strong>.</p>
    <p>In this study, geological and geophysical data collected from the intraplate deformation of central-west Iberia
    are used to describe the crustal structure affected by compressive stresses for the full length of 700 km of the
    <strong>Spanish-Portuguese Central System</strong> (SPCS). Unlike other ranges of the interior of Iberia (e.g., Iberian Chain),
    the role of tectonic inversion in the SPCS is negligible (except in the area closest to the Atlantic, containing
    a Mesozoic record). Because the rates of intraplate deformation in central Iberia during the Cenozoic appear
    to be much smaller than those typical of plate boundary orogens, the presence of thrusts with a throw up to
    5 km provides a very special character for this range. Another interesting aspect of the SPCS structural
    arrangement is the presence of a major strike-slip fault parallel to the thrusts with a 500-km-long trace: the
    <strong>Messejana-Plasencia (MP) Fault</strong>. To simultaneously interpret both types of structures, we explore the concept
    of strain partitioning in an intraplate tectonic regime subject to lithospheric folding. We also discuss the
    possible existence of a crustal detachment connecting the studied range with both related orogens: <strong>Betics
    (S) and Pyrenees (N)</strong>.</p>
